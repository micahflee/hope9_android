This is the Android app for the Hackers on Planet Earth conference for 2012, HOPE Number 9. It's designed to display the HOPE schedule and make it easy to keep track of talks you want to attend. It's based on the app I wrote for The Last HOPE, which can be found at https://github.com/micahflee/hope_android.

Most of the logic happens in a webview widget, so it's written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The rest is written in Java with the Android SDK.
